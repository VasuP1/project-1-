Salary Prediction and Skill Importance Analysis for Computer Science, Data Science, and AI Job Postings
1. Project Overview
This project aims to predict salaries for job postings and identify the most important skills required in the fields of Computer Science, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using machine learning techniques, we analyze job listings to derive insights on salary trends and key industry skills.
2. How to Use
The project consists of multiple steps:
Scraping job postings from online platforms.
Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
Extracting relevant features for modeling.
Training and evaluating salary prediction models.
Analyzing the importance of different skills.
Visualizing salary distributions and skill importance.
3. Training & Inferencing
Training is performed using supervised learning techniques.
The trained model can infer salary estimates for new job postings based on extracted features.
Feature importance analysis helps highlight the most valuable skills in the job market.

10. Discussion and Conclusions
10.1 Findings
Salaries vary significantly by location, with major cities offering the highest compensation.
Python is the most in-demand skill across multiple roles.
Cloud computing skills (AWS, Kubernetes) are becoming increasingly valuable.
10.2 Challenges
Some job postings lacked salary information, requiring estimation techniques.
Variability in job titles across platforms created challenges in standardization.
Skill extraction from job descriptions was complex due to unstructured text.
10.3 Recommendations
Expand dataset by incorporating more job sources.
Improve salary estimation by integrating external economic data.
Apply advanced NLP techniques for better skill extraction.
